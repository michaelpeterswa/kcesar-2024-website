      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p className="text-xl pt-8 text-justify px-20 container">
        King County Explorer Search & Rescue was founded in 1954 as one of the
        first organized search and rescue teams in the country, and the first to
        accept youth members. The &quot;Explorer&quot; in Explorer Search &
        Rescue comes from ESAR&apos;s affiliation with the Boy Scouts of America
        Learning for Life program. King County ESAR still maintains a Post with
        the Boy Scouts of America but we are not as directly associated with
        Scouting as we once were. Today, we are the largest of nine member-units
        of the King County Search & Rescue Association (KCSARA) and accept both
        adult and youth members each training season.
